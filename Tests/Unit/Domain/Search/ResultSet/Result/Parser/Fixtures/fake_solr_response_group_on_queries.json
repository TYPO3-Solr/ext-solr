Pages are organized into a hierarchical page tree. Each piece of content is clearly represented in the page module. All records can be accessed with a universal list module. Built-in WYSIWYG editors allow non-technical users to efficiently and effectively manage content. Publishing Content TYPO3 contains built-in versioning functionality that allows users to revert content to a previous version with ease. TYPO3 also features “workspaces,” which make it possible for users to edit content in one or more draft workspaces, and to confirm editorial approval before content is published. Multi-Language and Multiple Domains Support for multiple domains within a single TYPO3 installation and for multiple languages are built-in to the TYPO3 core and are integrated at every level of the system’s architecture. Runs everywhere You can install TYPO3 by downloading a zip-file or via composer . Putting it on a web server or on a cloud service like Microsoft Azure or Amazon AWS is simple - due to proper separation of content, configuration and other assets like caches and temporary files. Granular Frontend and Backend Access Rights All frontend pages and content can be limited to specific user groups. Backend editors can easily be restricted to specific sections of the page tree, modules, and directories in the file system. Your data - our strength TYPO3 can be installed on any database based on MySQL/MariaDB, postgreSQL, MSSQL or SQLite2 - due to the underlying database abstraction moving your data from one server to another with only little configuration changes. Full Responsive Backend The administration interface, called TYPO3 Backend, can be managed from any modern web browser, including tablets and smart phones the same way. Publishing a small change on-the-go or working with tablet devices to add content has never been easier. No Design Constraints For Your Web Project Because the TYPO3 frontend and backend are separate and distinct interfaces, developers have complete and total control of their frontend markup, CSS, and JavaScript, down to the most minute details. Frontend Editing While the backend offers complete control over all site content, TYPO3 also includes a frontend editing interface for even faster, more intuitive content management by non-technical editors. Enterprise Features In addition to everything one would expect in a sophisticated content management system, TYPO3 also possesses a number of important enterprise features including content-specific caching backends, a database abstraction layer, documented serviced-based APIs for authentication like LDAP and Active Directory, well-defined interfaces for third-party systems integration, reporting tools, a digital asset manager, and an interface for scheduled jobs.  And More... For a full list of all that the TYPO3 core has to offer, take a look at the feature matrix on typo3.org . Or browse the list of over 6.000 extensions on the TYPO3 extension repository.

Thus keeps your CMS flexible and your investments save. 6.000 Extensions and Counting TYPO3 is an extremely modular system that can be easily enhanced with custom extensions. All TYPO3 sites are built on top of the TYPO3 core, which contains the systems' fundamental functionality. Custom extensions interact with the core through the stable, clearly documented extension API. While the TYPO3 core does change in each new release, the interfaces between extensions and the core do not, ensuring easy updates and future-proof development. The TYPO3 Extension Manager TYPO3 relies on the TYPO3 extension manager - included in the TYPO3 core - for installing, activating, and deactivating extensions on a given TYPO3 installation. Extensions can be quickly imported and installed with just a couple clicks in the TYPO3 Admin Interface. Extension Builder simplifies extension development The Extension Builder helps you to build TYPO3 extensions based on the MVC framework Extbase and the Templating Engine Fluid. You can design your model with a graphic modeler and create Plugins or Backend modules. All required files are generated and you will have a basic extension where you can insert your domain logic. In contrary to the former kickstarter extension the extension builder has an edit mode that enables the continuous use during development. You can modify the auto-generated PHP classes (add new methods, modify the method bodies, add comments and annotations) and the extension builder preserves your changes, even if you then rename models or properties in the modeler. Extbase: TYPO3's Built-in MVC Framework Recent versions of TYPO3 CMS include a built-in Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework called Extbase, which allows developers to take advantage of this popular programming design pattern. Extbase a nice Domain-Driven-Design (DDD) approach for persisting DB records, as well as an action-controller based structure, which can be used for dynamic plugins in any frontend page, as well as custom Backend modules in TYPO3 itself. In fact, most of the default backend modules run with Extbase. Extbase is a backport of features from TYPO3 FLOW to TYPO3 CMS. Fluid: Next Generation Templating Fluid - TYPO3's next generation templating engine - is used for creating custom extension templates. Fluid was created for TYPO3 Flow and has been backported to TYPO3 CMS. Fluid's approach to creating templates emphasizes simplicity, flexibility, extensibility, and easy of use. The syntax is XML-based and can be extended in any Web IDE. With its ViewHelpers, Fluid can be extended by powerful functionality that fits custom web project needs. Fluid is used with Extbase by default, and can be used standalone in other PHP functions and has its own TypoScript Content Object \"FLUIDTEMPLATE\". Extensive Configuration Options Nearly every aspect of the TYPO3 backend is configurable and customizable. Backend interfaces can often be configured using TSConfig.
