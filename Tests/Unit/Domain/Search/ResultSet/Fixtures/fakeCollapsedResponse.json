It is saturday the 14th of november. Almost everyone has arrived at the castle in Behringen at around 2-3 o'clock in the afternoon. The castle is barrierfree, which means it is all adopted for disabled people. Although we are not working on accessibility I can safely assume most of the attendants support that. The castle itself is situated in a really nice rural environment. The air is really fresh. A welcome change for city dwellers. The whole castle belongs to the team this week. The network team, that rapidly volunteered, set up the whole wireless environment in a few hours. Punkt.de provided the switches they also use for the TYPO3 conferences. Joey brought a monster PC where he virtualised five servers. One for every team. Supportive tools like SVN, IRC and alike where all set up on this machine with the help of various people. Jens Hoffmann welcomed the attendants a little later in the afternoon and split up the available rooms among the attendants. After that the composition of the different teams was announced.                                                                                                                                                                                             30 hand-picked specializists participating in the T3UXW09",

The idea was to solve what had emerged as a problem for the young internet—as websites grew, the need to separate the management of design and content became apparent.    By August 2000, the core components were distributed to a development community that extended the concept and functionality of TYPO3 into the robust, and richly featured CMS that it is today.    TYPO3 now runs more than 500,000 websites worldwide and powers sites for many esteemed institutions, including Cisco Systems, General Electric, Mercedes-Benz, and Harvard University.

It is written in PHP and is compatible with a number of popular databases, including MySQL.

For the answer to most questions look first to the central   TYPO3 Document Library   where you will find several useful tutorials, and guides to installation, configuration, and getting started with TYPO3.      The Getting Started tutorial is based on the Introduction Package and is the number one resource to get you on your way with TYPO3.  The Getting Started tutorial's permanent URL is:   http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/tutorials/doc_tut_quickstart/current/                                                                                                  TYPO3 Wiki     Find additional documentation in the   TYPO3 Wiki  , which provides how-to guides conveniently classified for different types of TYPO3 users.        Editors   can find documents on how to handle and manage their content.      Administrators   can find documents on how to manage security, users, and fine-tune performance.      Developers   can find how-to guides to get started in creating their own TYPO3 extensions.      TYPO3 API Documentation     The TYPO3 source code contains abundant internal documentation, which will allow developers to understand many functions and features just by browsing through the various classes and methods. Because TYPO3 uses JavaDoc style documentation, it is possible to automatically create a complete documentation of the TYPO3 core.    Additionally, the   TYPO3 Core APIs   manual from the Documentation Library describes important components of the API, and gives many examples how to use it.",
