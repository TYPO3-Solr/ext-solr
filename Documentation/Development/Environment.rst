=======================
Development Environment
=======================

To simplify the development for TYPO3 and Solr related components we provide a development environment based on Docker and the DDEV of the TYPO3 core.

You can find the development box in the following git repository:

https://github.com/TYPO3-Solr/solr-ddev-site

When you start the box, you will find a pre-configured environment for the support TYPO3 version and the Solr installation that is needed for the installed EXT:solr version.
