Show Logging Output
-------------------

As written in the introduction, the logging framework functionally is used to write the log entries.

For a quick debugging without any extension there is the possibility to show the debug messages directly:

- For the frontend as formatted output.
- For the backend as TYPO3 console output.

**Note:** You should use this on a development system only and make sure that the devIPmask does not allow other users to see the debug output.

To enable this features you need to:

- Make sure that your ip address is configured to match the devIPMask ($GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['devIPmask'])
- Enable the debug output in the EXT:solr typoscript:


.. code-block:: typoscript

    plugin.tx_solr.logging.debugOutput = 1


You can now see the written log in the frontend:
