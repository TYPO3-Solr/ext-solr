Include in Search (no_search)
  By default, every allowed page is indexed. Use this flag to
  exclude the current page from being indexed.

Include sub entries in Search (no_search_sub_entries)
  Use this flag, to be able to exclude sub pages from index recursively.
  By unsetting this flag, the sub pages/entries of desired page will be excluded from index.

    .. tip::

        To exclude the page and its sub pages disable no_search and no_search_sub_entries at same time.
