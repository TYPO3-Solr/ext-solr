The **Index Queue** module is the most important module. It allows you to do the following things:

* Select item types and add them for indexing to the indexing queue.
* See the fill state of the indexing queue.
* Check the indexing queue for errors when the indexing of an items failed.
* Start an instant indexing run, directly from the module.
* Clear the indexing queue and re-queue items.


Index Maintenance
-----------------

The **Index Maintenance** module allows you, to do the following administrative operations on your solr index:

* Reload the solr configuration.
* Empty your solr index. This removes all documents from the index of the current selected site.

complete listing with hits etc. ranked by Top search keywords.

Stop Words
----------

With the stopwords module you can define a list of words that should be excluded from the search.

Common usecases are:

* Very often occuring words like "the", "and" ... are excluded are filtered out because they are more or less "noize words".
* You can add words that you want to avoid from indexing.


Synonyms
--------

With the synonyms module you can allow to find documents by words that do not occure in the document but have the same meaning:

* E.g. smartphone, cellphone, mobile, mobilephone

**Note:** The word that you want replace with a synonym needs to appear on **both** sides when you want to find it with the term itself later

Example

smartphone => smartphone, cellphone, mobile, mobilephone will match "smartphone, cellphone, mobile, mobilephone", when smartphone is missing on the right side, you will not find the document for smartphone anymore!
