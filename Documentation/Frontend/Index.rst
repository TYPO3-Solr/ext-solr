Frontend
========

This part of the documentation covers the frontend of EXT:solr.

NOTE: Since July 2016 EXT:solrfluid is available as an addon and it will be integrated into EXT:solr later.

The following part of the documentation describes the old way of templating. If you want to create your template in the new way, that will be the standard later please use EXT:solrfluid.
