Configure Extension
===================

After :ref:`started-install-extension` you need to configure the extension. The extension already
comes with basic configuration that will work for small pages out of the box. For further
configuration options head over to :ref:`conf-index` once everything is setup.

Static TypoScript
-----------------

For now create, or edit an existing, TypoScript Template record in your page tree and add the
provided static TypoScript:

.. image:: /Images/GettingStarted/typo3-include-static-typoscript.png

Update the constants to match the current setup::

    plugin {
        tx_solr {
            solr {
                host = 192.168.99.100
                port = 8282
            }
        }
    }

Adjust the host according to where your Solr is reachable, see :ref:`started-solr`.

Domain Records and Indexing
---------------------------

To enable Solr connections, the extension needs a Domain Record and indexing has to be enabled.
Therefore enable indexing by setting the following TypoScript::

    config {
        index_enable = 1
    }

Also define that your root page is actually a root page:

Last but not least, add the domain record to the root page:

.. image:: /Images/GettingStarted/typo3-domain-record.png

Initialize Solr Connection
---------------------------

Next, initialize the Solr Connection from TYPO3 and check whether everything works as expected.

To initialize the connection, open the Cache-Menu and start Initialization.

Check whether connections to Solr could be established by opening the *Reports* module and go to
*Status Report* view:

That's it, head over to :ref:`started-index`.
