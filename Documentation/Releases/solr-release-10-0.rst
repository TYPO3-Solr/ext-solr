============================
Apache Solr for TYPO3 10.0.0
============================

We are happy to release EXT:solr 10.0.0.
The focus of EXT:solr 10.0.0 was, to support introduced in TYPO3 9 LTS `site handling <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/9.5/en-us/ApiOverview/SiteHandling/Index.html />`_.

**Important**: This version is installable with TYPO3 9 LTS only.
Since the development budget is limited at one side and we have other project requests at the other side we could spend less time on the development of EXT:solr.
If you want to support us please consider to sponsor us.

New in this release
===================

TBD

Migration from EXT:solr 9 to EXT:solr 10
========================================

Important things on sites with activated Site Handling
------------------------------------------------------

By activating TYPO3 Site-Handling some classical things(configs, functions, etc.), that worked in TYPO3 prior 9.5 LTS, will become obsolete.
Following things will become standard, and should be preferred and activated/configured as close as possible and in some cases immediately,
otherwise the things wil not work or break the whole setup:

TypoScript
~~~~~~~~~~

plugin.tx_solr.solr
"""""""""""""""""""

This TypoScript configurations for Constants and for Setup are at least partially obsolete and are ignored on Site Handling activated sites.
All Apache Solr connections must be stored in Site Handling "config.yaml" file for each language.

config.absRefPrefix
"""""""""""""""""""

The `"config.absRefPrefix" <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-typoscript/master/en-us/Setup/Config/Index.html#absrefprefix />`_ is `obsolete <https://docs.typo3.org/c/typo3/cms-core/9.5/en-us/Changelog/9.4/Feature-86057-ImprovedTypolinkURLLinkGeneration.html />`_ and must be replaced with
Site Handlings `"base" <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/9.5/en-us/ApiOverview/SiteHandling/Basics.html#base />`_ or `"baseVariants" <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/reference-coreapi/9.5/en-us/ApiOverview/SiteHandling/BaseVariants.html />`_ settings.
