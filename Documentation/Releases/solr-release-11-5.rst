New in this release
===================

Support of TYPO3 11 LTS
-----------------------

With EXT:solr 11.5 we provide the support of TYPO3 11 LTS.


Bootstrap 5.1
-------------

The default templates provided by EXT:solr were adapted for Bootstrap 5.1.

The templates are also prepared to display some icons with Bootstrap Icons, but the usage is optional and the icons are no longer provided with EXT:solr as the former Glyphicons were.
