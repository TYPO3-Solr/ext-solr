Introduction
============


What does it do?
----------------

Apache Solr for TYPO3 is the search engine you were looking for with special
features such as **Facetted Search** or **Synonym Support** and an incredibly fast
response times of results within milliseconds.

When development started, the primary goal was to create a replacement for
Indexed Search. With the initial public release at T3CON09 in Frankfurt, Germany
that goal was reached and even passed by adding features which Indexed Search
does not support.

Feature List
------------

* Facetted Search
* Spellchecking / **Did you mean**
* **Multi Language Support**
* Search word highlighting
* Field Boosting for fine tuning the importance of certain index fields
* **Frontend User Group Access Restrictions Support**
* Stop word Support
* Synonym Support
* **Auto complete / Auto suggest**
* Language Analysis / Support for inflected word forms
* Content Elevation / **Paid Search Results** / Editorial Content
* Sorting of Results
* Content indexing through a near instant backend **Index Queue**
* Auto correction (search for the first suggestion)
* and more...
