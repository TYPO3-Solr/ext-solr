Introduction
============

What does it do?
----------------

Apache Solr for TYPO3 is the search engine you were looking for with special
features such as **Faceted Search** or **Synonym Support** and an incredibly fast
response times of results within milliseconds.

When development started, the primary goal was to create a replacement for
Indexed Search. With the initial public release at T3CON09 in Frankfurt, Germany
that goal was reached and even passed by adding features which Indexed Search
does not support.

With EXT:solr it is simple to build a search for a TYPO3 website, that allows you to index any kind of TYPO3 records with TCA configuration and pages.
The results can be rendered with flexible fluid templates, to render the results as you need them.
