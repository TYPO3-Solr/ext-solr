What does it do?
----------------

Apache Solr for TYPO3 is the search engine you were looking for with special
features such as Facetted Search or Synonym Support and an incredibly fast
response times of results within milliseconds.

When development started, the primary goal was to create a replacement for
Indexed Search. With the initial public release at T3CON09 in Frankfurt, Germany
that goal was reached and even passed by adding features which Indexed Search
does not support.

The extension is developed in a way so that public versions are released to TER from time to time.
Early access to the development version with more features can be gained through a paid development
partnership. That's necessary to make development possible. You may check http://www.typo3-solr.com
for more details.

This manual covers all features available in the development version, some of
them may not be available in the versions released to TER. Features which are
only available in the development version are marked.
