<p>A schema different
    from the one provided with the extension was detected.</p>
<p>It is recommended to use the
    schema.xml file shipping with the Apache Solr for TYPO3
    extension as it provides an optimized field setup for
    using Solr with TYPO3. A difference can occur when you
    update the TYPO3 extension, but forget to update the
    schema.xml file on the Solr server. The schema sometimes
    changes to accommodate changes or new features in Apache
    Solr. Also make sure to restart the Tomcat server after
    updating the schema.xml file.</p>
<p>Your Solr server is
    currently using schema version <strong>{solr.schema.name}</strong>, the
    recommended schema version is <strong>{recommendedVersion}</strong>. You can
    find the recommended <code>schema.xml</code> file in the extension's
    resources folder: <code>EXT:solr/Resources/Private/Solr/</code>. While
    you're at it, please make sure you're using the current <code>solrconfig.xml</code> file, too.</p>
